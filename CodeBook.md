### 1. Introductory information about the tidy dataset produced by run_analysis.R
------------
The run_analysis.R script produces a tidy dataset of 180 observations and 81 variables. The first two variables (columns 1 and 2) describe the activity and subject. Subject labels range between  1 and 30 (that is, there were 30 participants in the study) and the given activity is one of six types (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying). For each subject label and activity, the remaining 79 variables each provide an average value of a certian kind of measurement extracted from the Version 1.0 data.

All measurements were originally time domain signals captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Measurements were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. For more information, see section 3. 

__Important Distinction:__ The measurements appearing in the tidy data set represent the *average* over all measurements of the same name, for that subject and activity.

### 2. Information about data cleaning done in run_analysis.R
------------
The two main data sets that are merged and tidied are the training and test data sets:
* Testing data: test/X_test.txt
* Training data: train/X_train.txt

All of the other data sets loaded into R provide auxilary information about the names and labels describing the either the variables, the subjects, or the activities.

__What the script does:__

-In part (1) of the script, the two main data sets and auxilary data are loaded in.
-In part (2) of the script, a grep is performed on the list of variable descriptors to determine which measurements contain information about mean() or std() calculations. This includes measurements of meanFreq(). Then, then two main data sets are subsetted to retain only the columns corresponding with these measurements.
-In part (3) of the script, the auxiliary data is used to give names to the columns of the two main data sets. Also, additional columns are added to the two main data sets to indicate the Subject and Activity for each observation.
-In part (4) the two main data sets, now with descriptive variable names and extra columns, are merged with a row bind.
-In part (5) the unified dataset is further tidied by replacing numeric activity labels with better character descriptions.
-In part (6), the reshape2 library is loaded, and melt() and cast() are used to produced a tidy, summarized dataset that displays the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#### Feature Selection 

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
